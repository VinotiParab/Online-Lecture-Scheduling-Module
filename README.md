# Online-Lecture-Scheduling-Module

Overview: This will be a lecture scheduling module, you have to build an admin
panel wherein the admin should have the functionality to add courses and their
lectures along with the date of the lectures. The backend code written should make
sure that no two schedules set for lectures clash with each other.

Admin Panel:
1. admin can see list of all Instructors (You can add random users)
2. admin can add courses
Course will have the following details
a. Name
b. Level
c. Description
d. Image
e. Multiple Lectures (batches) -> can be added after the course is added.
as one course can have multiple batches
3. These lectures could be assigned to any instructor on any particular date.
Once a lecture is assigned to an instructor on a particular date, The admin
panel shouldn’t allow the instructor to be assigned to any other lecture on that
date.
4. When a course is added the dates will be assigned to the selected instructor
5. No other course can be assigned to that instructor with the same date again
(example: if a course’s lecture has been assigned to instructor rahul on 1st
January, then the admin should be unable to assign him any other lecture on
1st January.

Instructor panel: This panel should have the list of all lectures assigned to the logged
in instructor with dates and course names.
